# Ideation Helper

Transform brain dumps into structured project plans: briefs, phased plans, and action steps — designed for everyone, not just developers.

Based on [nicknisi/ideation](https://github.com/nicknisi/claude-plugins), adapted for non-technical projects like personal goals, home renovation, event planning, process design, and more.

## Skills

### ideation-helper

Transforms raw, unstructured brain dumps into actionable project artifacts through a confidence-gated workflow.

Use this when you have messy ideas, scattered thoughts, or dictated stream-of-consciousness about something you want to accomplish.

**How to invoke:**

```
/ideation-helper

[provide your brain dump - messy dictation, scattered thoughts, half-formed ideas]
```

**The workflow:**

1. **Intake** — Accept your messy, unstructured input without judgment
2. **Context gathering** — Scan existing files and ask about your situation, constraints, and resources
3. **Confidence scoring** — Assess understanding across 5 dimensions (0-100)
4. **Clarifying questions** — If confidence < 95%, ask targeted questions
5. **Brief** — When ≥ 95% confident, write `brief.md` to `./docs/ideation/{project}/`
6. **Phasing & action steps** — Determine phases, optionally generate plans, generate action steps
7. **Quality check** — Self-review action steps for verification coverage before presenting
8. **Execution handoff** — Present strategy (sequential, parallel, or agent team)

**Output artifacts:**

All artifacts are written to `./docs/ideation/{project-name}/`:

```
brief.md                              # Problem, goals, success criteria, scope
plan-phase-1.md                       # Phase 1 requirements (only if plans chosen)
action-steps-phase-1.md               # Phase 1 action steps
action-steps-template-{pattern}.md    # Shared template for repeatable phases
action-steps-phase-N.md               # Per-phase delta or full action steps
```

## Confidence Scoring

The skill scores your brain dump across 5 dimensions (20 points each):

| Dimension        | Question                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Problem Clarity  | Do I understand what problem we're solving? |
| Goal Definition  | Are the goals specific and measurable?      |
| Success Criteria | Can I write a checklist to verify "done"?   |
| Scope Boundaries | Do I know what's in and out of scope?       |
| Consistency      | Are there contradictions to resolve?        |

**Thresholds:**

- < 70: Major gaps — 5+ clarifying questions
- 70-84: Moderate gaps — 3-5 questions
- 85-94: Minor gaps — 1-2 questions
- ≥ 95: Ready to generate brief

## Commands

### /execute-spec

Executes action steps generated by the ideation skill. Reads the file, creates tasks with dependencies, and works through them step-by-step with verification.

```bash
# Auto-detect next unblocked task
/execute-spec

# Execute specific action steps
/execute-spec docs/ideation/my-project/action-steps-phase-1.md

# Parallel execution for independent tasks
/execute-spec --parallel
```

## Installation

# Then install
/plugin install ideation-helper
```

### From local directory
