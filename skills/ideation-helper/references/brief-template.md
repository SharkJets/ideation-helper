## Template Usage Notes

When filling this template:

1. **Problem Statement**: Be specific about WHO has the problem and WHAT the impact is. Avoid vague statements like "things aren't great" — instead say "I spend 30 minutes every evening figuring out what to cook, leading to unhealthy takeout 4x/week."

2. **Goals**: Use measurable language. Instead of "get more organized," say "cook at home at least 5 nights per week within the first month."

3. **Success Criteria**: Write as if you're creating a checklist you could hand to someone else to verify. Each criterion should be clearly pass/fail.

4. **Scope Boundaries**: When in doubt, list it as out of scope. It's easier to add later than to remove.

5. **Future Considerations**: Don't discard good ideas that are out of scope — park them here for later.
