## Template Usage Notes

When filling this template:

1. **Overall Approach**: Start with the big picture strategy, not the details. Help the reader understand the "why" before the "how."

2. **Deliverables**: List everything this phase produces. If it's not listed here, it won't get done. Be explicit.

3. **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Write steps as if someone else will follow them. Include enough detail that they won't need to ask you questions. Specify who does each step (you, Claude, a vendor, a friend, etc.) and what they need to do it.

4. **Verification Steps**: For each deliverable, describe how to confirm it's right. What would you check? What would you measure? Who would you ask?

5. **Contingency Plans**: Think about what could go wrong. Having a backup plan prevents panic. Focus on the most likely and most impactful risks.

6. **Completion Checklist**: This is your final quality gate. Everything here must be true before moving to the next phase. If any item fails, address it before proceeding.
