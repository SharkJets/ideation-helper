# Confidence Assessment Rubric

Use this rubric to score brain dump clarity before generating a brief.

**Threshold**: 95 points minimum to proceed to brief generation.

## Scoring Dimensions

### 1. Problem Clarity (0-20 points)

| Score | Criteria                                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-5   | Problem not stated or completely unclear. No idea what we're solving.                       |
| 6-10  | Problem mentioned but vague ("things aren't working", "I'm frustrated", "it's a mess").     |
| 11-15 | Problem clear but missing context: who experiences it, how often, or what impact.           |
| 16-20 | Problem crystal clear: who experiences it, what happens, when it occurs, impact quantified. |

**Questions to ask if low**:

- "What specific problem are you trying to solve?"
- "Who experiences this problem? How often?"
- "What's the cost of not solving this? (time, money, frustration)"
- "Can you describe a specific incident where this was a problem?"

**Examples**:

- Score 5: "I need to get organized"
- Score 10: "My mornings are chaotic"
- Score 15: "I spend 30 minutes every morning looking for things, which makes me stressed and late"
- Score 20: "I spend 30 minutes every morning searching for my keys, wallet, and work materials because I have no designated spots for them, making me late to work 3x/week and starting each day frustrated"

### 2. Goal Definition (0-20 points)

| Score | Criteria                                                                                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0-5   | No goals stated. Just a problem or complaint.                                                    |
| 6-10  | Vague aspirations ("make it better", "get organized", "be more productive").                     |
| 11-15 | Goals stated but unmeasurable ("mornings should feel calmer", "things should be more organized"). |
| 16-20 | Specific, measurable goals ("5-minute morning routine, out the door on time 5 days/week").       |

**Questions to ask if low**:

- "What does success look like for this project?"
- "How will you measure whether this worked?"
- "What specific number or metric should change? By how much?"
- "If this project succeeds, what will be different in 3 months?"

**Examples**:

- Score 5: (none stated)
- Score 10: "Be more organized"
- Score 15: "Mornings should go more smoothly"
- Score 20: "Have a 5-minute morning routine where everything is in its designated spot, leaving the house on time 5 days/week"

### 3. Success Criteria (0-20 points)

| Score | Criteria                                                                                          |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-5   | None provided. No way to know when we're done.                                                    |
| 6-10  | Subjective criteria only ("looks good", "feels organized", "I'm happy with it").                  |
| 11-15 | Some measurable criteria but incomplete coverage of goals.                                        |
| 16-20 | Clear, verifiable acceptance criteria for ALL stated goals. Anyone could check and confirm these. |

**Questions to ask if low**:

- "How will you know when this is done?"
- "What would you check to prove this worked?"
- "If someone else looked at the result, how would they know it's right?"
- "What would you show someone to prove success?"

**Examples**:

- Score 5: (none stated)
- Score 10: "It should feel organized"
- Score 15: "Everything has a spot" (good but how do you verify?)
- Score 20: "Every daily-use item has a labeled spot, morning routine takes under 10 minutes for a full week, no 'where is my...' moments for 7 consecutive days"

### 4. Scope Boundaries (0-20 points)

| Score | Criteria                                                                                      |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-5   | Unlimited scope. No boundaries stated. Everything could be in scope.                          |
| 6-10  | Some boundaries implied but not explicit. "We're not redoing everything" type statements.     |
| 11-15 | Boundaries stated but gaps exist. Some adjacent areas unclear.                                |
| 16-20 | Clear in/out of scope with rationale for exclusions. Future considerations noted.             |

**Questions to ask if low**:

- "What is explicitly NOT part of this project?"
- "Are there related things we should defer to later?"
- "What's the minimum viable version vs. nice-to-have?"
- "If you had half the time or budget, what would you cut?"
- "What related areas should we explicitly exclude?"

**Examples**:

- Score 5: "Organize the house" (could mean anything)
- Score 10: "Organize the entryway, nothing else" (vague)
- Score 15: "Set up an entryway station, but not the whole mudroom" (better but gaps)
- Score 20: "In scope: entryway organization, key/wallet station, daily bag prep area. Out of scope: full closet renovation (separate project), garage organization (phase 2). Future: seasonal gear rotation system after daily system is established."

### 5. Consistency (0-20 points)

| Score | Criteria                                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0-5   | Major contradictions in requirements. Impossible to satisfy both.  |
| 6-10  | Some conflicting statements that need resolution.                  |
| 11-15 | Minor inconsistencies that need clarification but aren't blockers. |
| 16-20 | Internally consistent throughout. No contradictions.               |

**Questions to ask if low**:

- "You mentioned [X] but also [Y]. These seem to conflict. Which takes priority?"
- "Earlier you said [A], but now [B]. Can you clarify?"
- "How should we handle [situation where goals conflict]?"
- "If we can only do one of [X] or [Y], which matters more?"

**Examples**:

- Score 5: "Keep it minimal" + "I want built-in shelving, a desk, and a reading nook" + "Budget is $200" (impossible)
- Score 10: "Keep it simple" + "Add all these custom features" (tension)
- Score 15: "Stay under budget" + "Use only high-end materials" (minor tension, resolvable with priorities)
- Score 20: All requirements align. Priorities clear when tradeoffs exist.

## Confidence Thresholds

| Total Score | Interpretation              | Action                                                                          |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| < 70        | Major gaps in understanding | Ask 5+ questions targeting lowest-scoring dimensions. May need multiple rounds. |
| 70-84       | Moderate gaps               | Ask 3-5 targeted questions. One more round likely sufficient.                   |
| 85-94       | Minor gaps                  | Ask 1-2 specific questions. Almost ready.                                       |
| ≥ 95        | Ready                       | Generate brief. Proceed to phasing and action steps.                            |

## Question Best Practices

When asking clarifying questions:

### Do:

- **Be specific**: "What storage do you need for daily-use items vs. seasonal items?" not "Tell me more about storage."
- **Offer options**: "Is the guest room A) critical to keep functional, B) okay to convert fully, or C) needs to serve double duty?"
- **Reference context**: "You mentioned 'natural light is important.' Does that mean no overhead lighting, or just supplementing with windows?"
- **Limit quantity**: 3-5 questions max per round. Don't overwhelm.
- **Prioritize**: Target the lowest-scoring dimension first.
- **Chain logically**: Questions should build understanding, not jump around.

### Don't:

- Ask open-ended questions: "Tell me more" is not useful.
- Ask redundant questions: If they said "home office," don't ask "is this for a workspace?"
- Ask leading questions: "You don't want to paint, right?" biases the answer.
- Ask compound questions: "What's the budget and timeline and who's helping?" is three questions.
- Skip context: Don't ask about something without referencing what they said.

## Scoring Worksheet

Use this to track your assessment:

| Dimension        | Score    | Notes |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----- |
| Problem Clarity  | /20      |       |
| Goal Definition  | /20      |       |
| Success Criteria | /20      |       |
| Scope Boundaries | /20      |       |
| Consistency      | /20      |       |
| **TOTAL**        | **/100** |       |

**Lowest dimension**: _________________ (target questions here first)

**Questions to ask**:

1.
2.
3.

## Recalculation

After each round of questions:

1. Re-read the original brain dump + new answers
2. Re-score all 5 dimensions
3. If still < 95, identify new lowest dimension
4. Ask targeted questions
5. Repeat until ≥ 95

**Typical progression**:

- Round 1: 50-65 → 70-80
- Round 2: 70-80 → 85-92
- Round 3: 85-92 → 95+

**Keep going until ≥ 95.** Score conservatively — when uncertain between two levels, always choose the lower one. Do not inflate scores to move forward faster. The goal is a good brief, not a fast one.

## Action Steps Quality Check

**Purpose**: Evaluate generated action steps for quality before presenting to user. This is separate from brain-dump confidence scoring above — it's applied during action steps review (Phase 4.5), not during brief formation.

### Quality Levels

| Level | Criteria | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Strong** | All major deliverables have verification steps. Completion checklist is defined and comprehensive. Contingency plans exist for high-risk items. Step-by-step instructions are detailed enough to follow without questions. | Present action steps as-is |
| **Adequate** | Most deliverables have verification steps but some gaps. Completion checklist exists but may miss edge cases. Instructions are mostly clear. | Present action steps with a note about gaps |
| **Weak** | No verification steps, or major deliverables have no way to confirm completion. Missing completion checklist or contingency plans for obvious risks. | Revise action steps before presenting — add verification and contingency plans |

### Quality Checklist

Run through this checklist for each generated set of action steps:

- [ ] **Deliverables are listed** — everything this phase produces is explicitly named
- [ ] **Steps are actionable** — each step says what to do, who does it, and what's needed
- [ ] **Verification steps exist** — each major deliverable has a way to confirm it's correct
- [ ] **Contingency plans cover risks** — likely problems have backup plans
- [ ] **Completion checklist is comprehensive** — covers all deliverables and quality standards
- [ ] **No ambiguity** — someone unfamiliar with the project could follow the instructions

### Actions

- **Strong** → Present action steps to user for approval
- **Adequate** → Present with a note: "Verification could be stronger for {deliverable} — consider adding {specific suggestion}"
- **Weak** → Do not present. Revise to add verification steps and contingency plans, then re-evaluate
