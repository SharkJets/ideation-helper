# Action Steps: Home Office Renovation - Phase 1

**Brief**: ./brief-example.md
**Plan**: ./plan-example.md
**Time Estimate**: A week or more

*Note: This example omits sections not applicable to this phase (no open questions remain after planning). Include all sections when they apply to your action steps.*

## Overall Approach

Phase 1 follows a research-first approach: measure the space, research options within budget, purchase, then assemble and test. This order prevents the common mistake of buying furniture that doesn't fit or isn't ergonomic.

The desk position is the most important decision — it determines natural light exposure, camera angle for video calls, and available wall space for later phases. We'll solve that first by mapping the room, then select furniture that fits the layout.

## Deliverables

| Deliverable | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Room measurements document | Floor plan with dimensions, outlet locations, window positions, and chosen desk placement |
| Desk | 48"+ work surface assembled and positioned for optimal light and space |
| Ergonomic chair | Adjustable chair with lumbar support, set to correct height |
| Monitor arm | VESA-compatible arm with monitor positioned at eye level |
| Cable management | Clean cable routing from desk to outlets |

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Research & Measurements

**Overview**: Map the room and research furniture options before purchasing anything.

**What you need**:
- Tape measure
- Notebook or phone for notes
- Phone camera for reference photos

**Steps**:

1. Measure the room dimensions (length, width, ceiling height) — write these down
2. Note the locations of all electrical outlets, light switches, and ethernet jacks
3. Measure the window dimensions and distance from floor
4. Take photos of the room from each corner for reference
5. Test desk placement options: try positioning a table (or mark with tape) in 2-3 spots and sit there for 10 minutes each. Note where natural light hits your face (important for video calls — light should face you, not be behind you)
6. Choose the best desk position based on light, outlet access, and remaining room space
7. Create a simple floor plan sketch with measurements and chosen desk position
8. Research desks: look for 48"+ width, sturdy construction, 4+ star ratings with 500+ reviews. Budget: $800 max. Check dimensions against your room plan.
9. Research chairs: look for adjustable height, lumbar support, armrests, breathable material, 4+ star ratings. Budget: $500 max.
10. Research monitor arms: confirm your monitor's VESA compatibility (check the back for 75mm or 100mm hole pattern), then find a compatible arm. Budget: $100 max.

**How to verify**: Your floor plan sketch should show exact dimensions, outlet locations, and the chosen desk position. Furniture selections should have links, prices, and dimensions that fit your plan.

### Purchasing

**Overview**: Order the selected furniture and accessories.

**What you need**:
- Finalized furniture selections with links
- Budget tracker (simple list: item, price, running total)

**Steps**:

1. Verify all selected items are in stock and check delivery timeframes
2. Double-check that desk dimensions fit the planned location (allow 2-3 inches of clearance on each side)
3. Order the desk
4. Order the chair
5. Order the monitor arm
6. Order a cable management tray that fits under the desk (optional but recommended, ~$20-30)
7. Update your budget tracker with actual prices and expected delivery dates

**How to verify**: Total spend for this phase should be under $1,400. All items should arrive within 1-2 weeks. Confirm order confirmations received for each item.

### Assembly & Setup

**Overview**: Clear the old setup, assemble new furniture, and dial in ergonomics.

**What you need**:
- Screwdriver (Phillips and flathead)
- Allen keys (usually included with furniture)
- A helper for heavy lifting (desk assembly is usually a 2-person job)
- Your floor plan sketch for positioning

**Steps**:

1. Clear the room: remove the folding table and old chair. Decide now: donate, trash, or store.
2. Assemble the desk following manufacturer instructions. Position it in the planned spot from your floor plan.
3. Assemble the chair following manufacturer instructions.
4. Install the monitor arm on the desk (clamp or grommet mount — check what your desk supports).
5. Mount the monitor on the arm.
6. Adjust the chair height so your feet are flat on the floor and your forearms are parallel to the desk surface when typing.
7. Adjust the monitor height so the top of the screen is at or slightly below eye level.
8. Adjust the monitor distance so it's about an arm's length away.
9. Install the cable management tray under the desk and route all cables through it.
10. Sit and work for at least 2 hours, making small adjustments to chair and monitor position as needed.

**How to verify**: Sit at the desk in your working position. Check: feet flat on floor? Forearms parallel to desk? Top of monitor at eye level? No neck craning up or down? Chair lumbar support hitting your lower back? If any answer is no, adjust before proceeding.

### Full-Day Comfort Test

**Overview**: Work a full day to confirm the setup is comfortable and functional.

**What you need**:
- A normal workday with video calls scheduled

**Steps**:

1. Work a full 8-hour day at the new setup
2. Note any discomfort at the 2-hour, 4-hour, and 6-hour marks
3. Make adjustments as needed (chair height, monitor angle, arm height)
4. Pay attention to the desk surface: is there enough room for your keyboard, mouse, notebook, and drink?
5. Join at least one video call and check: does the new position work for your camera angle? Is the background behind you acceptable?
6. At the end of the day, note what works and what needs adjustment

**How to verify**: After the full day, you should have no significant back, neck, or wrist pain. Minor adjustments are normal in the first few days, but sharp pain or persistent discomfort means something needs to change.

## Verification Steps

- [ ] Room measurements document is complete with dimensions, outlets, windows, and desk position
- [ ] Desk is stable (no wobble) and has adequate surface area for daily work
- [ ] Chair height, lumbar support, and armrests are properly adjusted
- [ ] Monitor is at eye level and arm's length distance
- [ ] Cables are routed cleanly, not tangled on the floor
- [ ] Full-day comfort test passed with no significant pain
- [ ] Total phase spend is under $1,400

## Contingency Plans

| Risk | Likelihood | Backup Plan |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Furniture doesn't fit the planned space | Low | Return and order a smaller option. This is why we measure first. |
| Item arrives damaged | Medium | Contact seller for replacement immediately. Most have 30-day return windows. Use the old folding table in the meantime. |
| Over budget after selections | Medium | Drop the cable management tray (route cables manually) or look for open-box/refurbished chair options. |
| Assembly too difficult solo | Low | Ask a friend or hire TaskRabbit for assembly (~$50-80). Worth it to avoid injury or frustration. |
| Chair is uncomfortable after break-in | Medium | Most ergonomic chairs have a 30-day return policy. Don't remove tags until you've done the full-day test. |
