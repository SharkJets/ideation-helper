# Home Office Renovation Brief

**Created**: 2026-02-16
**Confidence Score**: 96/100
**Status**: Approved

## Problem Statement

Working from home 4 days/week in a spare bedroom that was never designed as an office. The desk is a folding table, lighting causes eye strain during video calls, there's no storage for work materials, and the room echoes badly on calls. Productivity drops noticeably in the afternoon due to discomfort, and colleagues have commented on the poor video/audio quality.

## Goals

1. **Create a comfortable, ergonomic workspace** that supports 8-hour workdays without physical strain
2. **Improve video call quality** (lighting, background, audio) to professional standards
3. **Add organized storage** for work materials, supplies, and reference documents
4. **Complete the renovation within a $2,500 budget**

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Desk and chair support comfortable 8-hour workdays (no back/neck pain after 1 week of use)
- [ ] Video call lighting is even with no harsh shadows (tested on 3 calls)
- [ ] Audio echo is eliminated (confirmed by 2 colleagues on test calls)
- [ ] All work materials have designated storage locations
- [ ] Background on video calls looks clean and professional
- [ ] Total spend stays under $2,500

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope

- Desk, chair, and monitor setup
- Lighting (overhead + task + video call)
- Acoustic treatment (echo reduction)
- Storage solutions (shelving, filing, cable management)
- Video call background setup

### Out of Scope

- Full room repaint or flooring — cosmetic only, not functional
- HVAC changes — existing heating/cooling is adequate
- Network/internet upgrades — current connection is fine

### Future Considerations

- Standing desk converter (try seated setup first)
- Soundproofing for music/podcasting (not needed for calls alone)
- Second monitor (evaluate after 1 month with new setup)
