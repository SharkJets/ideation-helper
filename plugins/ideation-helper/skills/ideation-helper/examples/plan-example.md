# Plan: Home Office Renovation - Phase 1

**Brief**: ./brief-example.md
**Phase**: 1 of 3
**Focus**: Furniture and ergonomic setup

## Phase Overview

Phase 1 tackles the foundation of a functional workspace: the desk, chair, and monitor setup. These are the most impactful changes — every other improvement (lighting, acoustics, storage) builds on having a proper work surface and seating first.

This phase is sequenced first because furniture determines the room layout. Lighting placement, acoustic panel positioning, and storage locations all depend on where the desk and chair end up. Getting this right first prevents rework later.

After this phase, you'll have a comfortable, ergonomic workspace that supports full workdays without physical strain. The folding table and mismatched chair will be replaced with purpose-built office furniture.

## Who Benefits and How

1. This phase helps **you** by eliminating the back and neck pain caused by the folding table and non-ergonomic chair
2. This phase helps **your colleagues** by providing a stable, professional-looking workspace for video calls (no more wobbly table)
3. This phase helps **the overall project** by establishing the room layout that all subsequent phases (lighting, acoustics, storage) will build around

## What Needs to Happen

### Research & Planning

- Measure the room dimensions and available wall space
- Document existing furniture, outlets, and window locations
- Research desks that fit the space (minimum 48" wide for monitor + laptop)
- Research ergonomic chairs with lumbar support and adjustable height
- Research monitor arms compatible with your monitor's VESA mount

### Purchasing

- Select and order a desk within the $800 furniture budget
- Select and order an ergonomic chair within the $500 chair budget
- Select and order a monitor arm within the $100 accessories budget
- Order any needed accessories (desk mat, cable management tray)

### Setup & Assembly

- Clear the room of the old folding table setup
- Assemble the new desk and position it optimally for natural light
- Assemble and adjust the chair to proper ergonomic height
- Install the monitor arm and position the monitor at eye level
- Route cables cleanly using the cable management tray

## Quality Standards

- **Budget**: Stay within $1,400 for this phase (desk $800, chair $500, accessories $100)
- **Timeline**: Complete within 2 weeks from start (including delivery time)
- **Comfort**: Chair and desk should be rated 4+ stars with 500+ reviews
- **Ergonomics**: Monitor at eye level, keyboard at elbow height, feet flat on floor

## What Must Be Done First

- Room measurements taken and documented
- Budget allocated ($1,400 of $2,500 total)
- Current furniture removal plan (donate, trash, or store the folding table)

## What This Phase Produces

- Functional desk and ergonomic chair setup
- Room measurements and layout document (used by Phase 2 and 3)
- Monitor positioned at ergonomic height with adjustable arm
- Clean cable routing
- Remaining budget confirmed for Phase 2 ($1,100)

## Done Checklist

- [ ] Desk assembled and positioned with adequate workspace (48"+ surface)
- [ ] Chair assembled with lumbar support, armrests, and height properly adjusted
- [ ] Monitor mounted on arm at eye level (top of screen at or slightly below eye height)
- [ ] Cables routed cleanly (not tangled on floor)
- [ ] Room measurements document completed and saved
- [ ] Comfortable for a full 8-hour workday (tested for at least one full day)
- [ ] Phase spending under $1,400

## Open Questions

- Does the desk need a keyboard tray, or is the desk surface at the right height?
- Should the desk face the window (natural light but potential glare) or be perpendicular to it?
