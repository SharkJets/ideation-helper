# Progress Check Guide

Use this guide when generating progress checks for action steps. Each major activity should define a way to verify it's on track *during* execution, not just at the end.

## Task-Type Mapping

Match the check method to the type of task:

| Task Type | Check Method | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Research/analysis | Review findings summary | "Does this list of vendors cover all categories?" |
| Writing/content creation | Review draft against brief | "Does this draft address all key points from the brief?" |
| Purchasing/procurement | Compare against requirements | "Does this item match the specifications and budget?" |
| Physical setup/arrangement | Photo or walkthrough | "Take a photo and compare to the plan" |
| Process design | Pilot test | "Run through the process once and note friction points" |
| Communication/outreach | Response check | "Did everyone confirm? Follow up with non-responders" |
| Planning/scheduling | Timeline review | "Are all dates realistic? Any conflicts?" |

## Three Design Questions

For each major activity, answer:

### 1. How will you check progress?

What's the quickest way to see if this step is on track?

- **Review against a list**: Compare your output to the requirements or criteria from the brief
- **Get a second opinion**: Ask someone else to look at it (a friend, Claude, a professional)
- **Compare to a reference**: Look at examples of good outcomes and compare yours
- **Test it out**: Try using or doing the thing and see if it works as expected

### 2. What does "good enough" look like?

Not "is it perfect?" but "does it meet the criteria?" Good benchmarks:

- Are specific: "fits in the 5x8 space" not "is the right size"
- Are verifiable: someone else could check and agree
- Match the brief's success criteria
- Account for the most important scenarios, not every edge case

### 3. How fast can you check?

Can you verify in minutes, not hours? Prefer:

- A quick visual comparison over a detailed analysis
- Checking the most important criteria first
- Asking one targeted question over a lengthy review
- Spot-checking key items over verifying everything

The check should be **fast enough that you'll actually do it** between steps, not so thorough that you skip it because it's tedious.

## When to Skip Progress Checks

Not every activity needs a mid-step check. Skip it for:

- Simple pass/fail tasks ("buy the paint" — either you bought it or you didn't)
- One-step activities with obvious outcomes
- Tasks where the result is immediately visible
- Quick items that take less time to do than to verify

**Rule of thumb**: "Will I be going back and forth on this activity, making adjustments?" If yes, add a progress check. If it's a one-and-done action, skip it.

## Mapping Existing Resources to Checks

When context gathering finds existing resources, use them for progress checks:

| Existing Resource | Use It For |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Prior plans or documents | Compare new work against established patterns |
| Photos or measurements | Verify physical work matches specifications |
| Budget spreadsheets | Track spending against limits in real time |
| Contact lists | Confirm outreach coverage |
| Checklists from similar projects | Borrow verification criteria |
| Feedback from previous attempts | Avoid known pitfalls |

If similar work has been done before, reference it: "Check this against the approach used for {previous project}." This gives you a concrete comparison point.
