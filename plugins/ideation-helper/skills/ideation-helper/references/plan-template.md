## Template Usage Notes

When filling this template:

1. **Phase Overview**: Explain WHY this phase exists and what's special about it. Don't just list activities.

2. **Who Benefits and How**: Focus on the value delivered, not the tasks performed. "This helps me by giving me a comfortable workspace" not "This involves buying a desk."

3. **What Needs to Happen**:
   - Group by activity area (e.g., "Research," "Purchasing," "Setup")
   - Be specific enough to act on but not so detailed you're writing step-by-step instructions
   - Use plain language anyone could understand

4. **Quality Standards**: Don't skip these. Timeline, budget, and quality expectations prevent scope creep and disappointment.

5. **What Must Be Done First / What This Phase Produces**: Be explicit about what must exist before starting and what you're delivering for the next phase or for others.

6. **Done Checklist**: Write these as if someone else will verify them. Each item should be clearly pass/fail.

7. **Open Questions**: Don't hide uncertainty. Surface it here so it gets addressed during execution.
